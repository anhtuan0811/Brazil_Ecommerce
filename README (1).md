# E-commerce EDA and RFM

## Dataset
The dataset I used is from Kaggle.com, and it is provided by the largest Brazilian online department store called olist. From the database sigma below you will see, the dataset contains 8 separated datasets in total, stored multi-dimensional data about over 100k orders' information of olist from end of 2016 to 2018. 

## Question
Can you predict customer segments based on the RFM model in the dataset?
