  - The time-saving of credit card is the reason make it become the most popular one. 
  - Secondly, Credit card is also linked with the installment of banks and finance services. The procedure to start an installment is easy and fast.

- One-time payments constitute a significant majority, accounting for 96% of all transactions within this payment sequence. This indicates that one-time payments are heavily favored or commonly used in this context. On the other hand, installment payments are relatively rare or infrequently used compared to one-time payments.

# 6. Conclusion & Recommendation
- According to the analysis, I have observed significant numbers as follow:
  - Family and sporty items are the most purchased items. There are also other trending products followed by different months.
  - The company has excelled in delivery service, but it's challenging to deliver to some remote states due to geographical limitations.
  - Credit cards are the most popular financial service.
  - The company's services have received excellent reviews from customers, with the majority being 5-star ratings.

- ðŸš© Therefore, I believe that this E-commerce should:
  - Run creative seasonal marketing campaigns with different items.
  - Implement recommendation marketing services to promote the business.
  - For remote areas, to enhance services and quality, specific campaigns should be created, such as offering more vouchers and discounts to improve their experience.
  - Continue collaborating with local businesses, such as banks and financial services, to enhance customer service experiences.
- Regarding the trending purchases by Brazilians, overall, we can see that E-commerce has experienced sustainable growth in total orders over time. Especially in November 2017, there was a significant surge in orders, possibly due to the Proclamation of the Republic of Brazil. I believe that the E-commerce company took advantage of this event to promote its business.
